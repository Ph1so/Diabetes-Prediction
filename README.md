### Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project

# Overview

This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on predicting diabetes using relevant medical data. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various input features.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of 2460 samples with 8 features, including age, BMI, insulin, and more. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehababoelnaga/diabetes-dataset).

# Approach

In this project, I employed several different machine learning models from Scikit-learn to train and evaluate the predictive model. The steps involved in the process include:

- Importing data: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features.
- Understanding data: Understanding data distribution and correlation matrix
- Model training: Training the selected algorithm on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

# Results

Currently, the trained model achieved an accuracy score of 80%.
